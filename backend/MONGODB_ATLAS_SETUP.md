# MongoDB Atlas Setup Guide

## Current Status
âœ… **Backend is now running successfully with local MongoDB**
âœ… **No more connection timeout errors**
âœ… **Task polling service working properly**

## Local MongoDB (Current Setup)
Your backend is currently configured to use local MongoDB which is more reliable for development.

### To continue with local MongoDB:
1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system
2. No additional configuration needed - everything is working!

## Switching to MongoDB Atlas

If you want to switch back to MongoDB Atlas, follow these steps:

### 1. Fix Atlas IP Whitelist
- Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
- Navigate to Network Access
- Ensure you have these entries:
  - `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow access from anywhere) - for development only
  - Or your specific IP: `89.39.107.193`

### 2. Verify Atlas Cluster Status
- Check if your cluster is running and accessible
- Verify the connection string is correct
- Test connection from Atlas dashboard

### 3. Update .env Configuration
In your `.env` file, comment out local MongoDB and uncomment Atlas:

```env
# Database - Use local MongoDB for development (more reliable)
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fashionx-local
# Atlas MongoDB (uncomment when Atlas is properly configured)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://prashantdesale259:jDMqLOlRZJhOztx8@cluster0.fobyotd.mongodb.net/deepnex-fashionX-31?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=10000&connectTimeoutMS=10000&socketTimeoutMS=20000
```

### 4. Test Atlas Connection
Restart your server and check if Atlas connection works:
```bash
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting Atlas Issues

### Common Problems:
1. **IP Whitelist Issues**
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` to Network Access in Atlas
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate

2. **Cluster Paused**
   - Check if your Atlas cluster is paused
   - Resume the cluster if needed

3. **Wrong Credentials**
   - Verify username and password in connection string
   - Check if user has proper database permissions

4. **Network Issues**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try connecting from Atlas dashboard first

### Atlas Connection String Format:
```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## Recommendation

**For Development**: Continue using local MongoDB (current setup)
- More reliable and faster
- No internet dependency
- No IP whitelist issues
- Better for development workflow

**For Production**: Use MongoDB Atlas
- Better for production deployment
- Managed service with backups
- Scalable and secure

## Current Backend Status
ðŸŸ¢ **All systems working perfectly!**
- Database: Connected to local MongoDB
- Server: Running on port 5000
- Task Polling: Working without errors
- All APIs: Functional and ready
